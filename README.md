# 🚀 CIVITAAS — Decentralized Welfare Access & Consent Platform
### *Upgraded version of DeCoMan, now built for real social impact on Algorand*

> ⚠️ NOTE: This repository was originally created for **DeCoMan (Decentralized Consent Manager)**.  
> The project has now evolved into **CIVITAAS** but continues inside the same repository for continuity, historical reference, and version upgrades.

## 🧠 What is CIVITAAS?

**CIVITAAS** is a decentralized platform built to help underserved and unaware citizens discover and access government welfare schemes using a **privacy-first, tokenized eligibility verification system**.

Users can:
- Upload / verify identity documents via Mock DigiLocker
- Generate **tokenized eligibility score**
- View recommended government schemes based on score
- Control data using **decentralized consent**
- Maintain trust with **immutable audit trails** on Algorand

## 🌱 Evolution From DeCoMan → Civitaas

| DeCoMan | Civitaas |
|--------|---------|
| Decentralized consent management | Full welfare access + eligibility scoring |
| DPDPA-driven digital consent | Global modular system design |
| On-chain audit trail | Tokenized proof + social impact |
| Prototype | Pilot-ready real-world platform |
| Basic blockchain integration | Scalable, optimized with Reti-Pooling + Intermezzo |
