## 🧠 What is CIVITAAS?

**CIVITAAS** is a decentralized platform built to help underserved and unaware citizens discover and access government welfare schemes using a **privacy-first, tokenized eligibility verification system**.

Users can:
- Upload / verify identity documents via Mock DigiLocker
- Generate **tokenized eligibility score**
- View recommended government schemes based on score
- Control data using **decentralized consent**
- Maintain trust with **immutable audit trails** on Algorand
